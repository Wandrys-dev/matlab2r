# matlab2r: a translation layer from MATLAB to R

This is an R package to facilitate the usage of MATLAB functions in R.

Both languages contain functions with similar purpose, but different names.
This package allows an R user comfortable with MATLAB to use several MATLAB
functions in R.

# Installation

You can install the development version of matlab2r by running the following command
in R (requires the `remotes` package to be installed beforehand):
